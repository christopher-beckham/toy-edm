# toy-edm

This repository contains clean implementations of EDM (or parts of EDM) in self-contained Jupyter notebooks:
- `1d-example.ipynb`: EDM on a toy 1D bimodal Gaussian dataset.
- `test-samplers.ipynb`: the analytical denoiser demonstrated on CIFAR10. Not sure if I've coded this up correctly as I have been unable to match the results shown in the original paper.
